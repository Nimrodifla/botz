                <h1 id="what-is-botz-">What is Botz?</h1>
                <p>Botz is a cryptocurrency that was created by three friends: Nimi, Bishi, Fifi (there&#39;s another one, Didi, but we don&#39;t allow him to participate). Botz was created to handle money transfers between friends more easly, than transfer actual money from your bank.</p>
                <h2 id="crypto-what-">Crypto what?</h2>
                <p>Cryptocurrency (or just &#39;crypto&#39;), is a virtual currency (money). You can buy and sell crypto, transfer it to others and also recieve from others. Crypto can be converted back to money (USD, ILS, or anything else) by selling it and recieving actual (non crypto) money in return.</p>
                <h1 id="what-makes-botz-so-special-">What makes Botz so special?</h1>
                <p>Botz is special because it doesn&#39;t work like any other crypto, Botz can only get more valuable! Botz&#39;s price can only go up!</p>
                <h2 id="how-does-it-work-">How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Botz works differently, the way Botz changes it&#39;s value (only adds to it&#39;s value) is by Ad (Advertisement) revenue from the Botz website, meaning, any revenue from the site, goes directly to the total value of Botz, that causes the increase in value of the holding of each Botz holder.</p>
                <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
                <p>Let&#39;s say there are only two owners of Botz, Nimi and Fifi.<br>
                Nimi has 50 Botz<br>
                and Fifi has 100 Botz<br></p>
                <p>For this example, we will say each Botz worth exactly 1$ (1 USD).
                Let&#39;s say a lot of people visiting the Botz website to learn about it and start owning some, and the website ad revenue is 150$. This revenue will go directly into the total value of Botz, meaning: 50 Botz of Nimi + 100 Botz of Fifi = 150 Botz which are 150$, after we add the ad revenue (150$), the total value of Botz is now 150 + 150 = 300$. 300$ / 150 (amount of Botz) = 2$ (Now each Botz worth 2$ insead of 1$).</p>
                <h2 id="another-interesting-point">Another interesting point</h2>
                <p>Because of the unique way Botz works (getting valuable from the site&#39;s ad revenue), the more people using Botz and getting exposed to the ads - the more valuable Botz will get.</p>
                <h1 id="so-how-do-i-start-">So how do I start?</h1>
                <p>You create an account, deposit money, and Botz will show in your page!<br>
                You can now have fun transfer Botz to your friends.<br>
                Remember, the more people using Botz - the more valuable it gets! So Share!</p>
